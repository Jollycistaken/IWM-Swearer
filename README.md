# IWM Swear Discord Bot
I got kinda of bored and made this. This discord bot has 1 command and that is "swear" (and technically help but shh) and that command will select a random swear word based on the I Wanna Maker bad word list.

## Building
1. Create a .env file at the root directory of this project
2. In the .env file put in `DISCORD_TOKEN=(bot's token)`
3. Run ``cargo build --release`` or ``cargo run --release`` on your terminal
4. Make sure the .env file is in the same directory as the built exe (unless you are using cargo run then root project)
