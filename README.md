# IWM Swear Discord Bot
I got kinda of bored and made this. This discord bot has 1 command and that is "swear" (and technically help but shh) and that command will select a random swear word based on the I Wanna Maker bad word list.

## Building
Run ``cargo build --release`` or ``cargo run --release`` on your terminal

## Usage
1. Make a .env file in the same directory as the binary
2. In the .env file put in `DISCORD_TOKEN=(your bot token)`
